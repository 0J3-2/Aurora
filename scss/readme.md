# Aurora Base SCSS

The base file is organized into several chapters. Within each chapter, there is a section. Each section contains it's designated SCSS rules. This format makes the theme easy to update and easy to modify.

## Notice

Since 0J3 has started maintaining the project, it has started to have less of the above, and more of a folder-structure-type of syntax.
